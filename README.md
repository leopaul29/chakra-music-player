# Custom Music Player with smooth animation

For the [Hashnode and Vercel hackathon](https://townhall.hashnode.com/announcing-hashnode-hackathon-powered-by-vercel), I want to build a music player (entertainment category) with random clip animation.

# idea

## animations
 [] on click on play button, make the bike arrive from the left to the middle and "ride" animation
 [] on pause, the "ride" animation stop
 [] on continue, the "ride" animation continue
 [] on click on next button, the bike disapear to the right and another bike and background color appears for the new song
